- 👋 Hi, I’m @themediocredev. I am a wanna-be dev that says that he does good projects but actually copy and pastes code from other people and then reworks it as his. 
- 👀 I’m interested in something
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and kotlin
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything
- 📫 Reach me by giving me a DM on elcapybara#1790 (discord)
